    Rivers start up high
        in the mountains
        Whimsical and new

    Rivers finish low
        in the deltas
        Holding hands with the ocean

    Quick quiz
        Name 6 Australian rivers
        They're all in the cities
        holding people together

    My most important thing
        is carrying you on my back
        swimming the mighty Murray River
        from NSW to Victoria

    Rivers are a long chord
        swimming, growing, refreshing
        at rest, intertwined with life
        just as they are
