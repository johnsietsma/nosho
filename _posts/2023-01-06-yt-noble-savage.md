Modern life is corruption. Looks at social media and the banality of office work. Everyone is soft and drugged by glowing rectangles.

I’ve found a link back to times of self-reliance, adventure and communion with nature. It’s called YouTube.

People in nature are always happier. I like to watch them.

My experience with nature is pretty excruciating. My phone battery dies pretty quickly and then I’m stuck. There are bugs and uncomfortable beds. It gets cold overnight.

Watching let’s me skip the boring bits.

When I see people traveling free in their vans, I know they’re getting more sex then me. Probably at every stop. And if they’re not, then they don’t want it anyway. They have their shit together. They’ve had time to work on themselves and be their own companion.

My life is too busy to really have time to think. I don’t go in for the New Age stuff, but I feel like I get some wisdom nuggets from people who have traveled in vans. They’ve sat through the hard times and I can get the condensed version. A little bit of their inner peace rubs off on me.

I’m real about it though. I know there are a bunch of wannabes spoiling Instagram locations. Not everyone can, or should be on YouTube. Some of them are too disrespectful. Flashing up lots of graphics and yelling stupid stuff.

Maybe we should have restrictions on them. Allow certain amount per area or something. That would be more efficient as well. Then you don’t get lots people doing the same thing.
